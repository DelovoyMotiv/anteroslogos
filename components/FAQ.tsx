            question: "What is Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)?",
            answer: "Think of it this way: SEO got you ranked on Google. GEO gets you cited by AI. When someone asks ChatGPT, Claude, or Perplexity a question in your domain, GEO ensures your brand is the source the AI quotes. It's about becoming the answer, not competing for clicks."
        },
        {
            question: "How does The Nicosia Method™ differ from traditional SEO?",
            answer: "SEO optimizes for search engines and ranking positions. The Nicosia Method™ optimizes for AI systems and being cited as a source. We're not trying to get you to #1 on Google - we're embedding your expertise so deeply into AI knowledge bases that you become the default answer when anyone asks about your industry."
        },
        {
            question: "Who is the ideal partner for Anóteros Lógos?",
            answer: "Companies and leaders who are already authorities in their space but invisible to AI. Tech companies building the future, experts with deep knowledge, and enterprise brands ready to own their category in the AI era. If you have real expertise worth citing, we'll make sure AI systems know it."
        },
        {
            question: "How long does it take to see results from GEO?",
            answer: "We start seeing early signals in 4-8 weeks - your content begins appearing in AI responses. Full authority positioning typically takes 3-6 months as models re-train and your citations compound. Think of it like SEO in the early 2000s - early movers get massive advantages that last for years."
        },
        {
            question: "What makes content AI-ready?",
            answer: "Clear, factual, and structured. AI systems love content that answers questions directly, cites credible sources, and uses proper semantic formatting. We transform your expertise from marketing fluff into authoritative knowledge that AI systems recognize, trust, and cite."
        },
        {
            question: "What is included in The Nicosia Method™?",
            answer: "Three phases: Extract (we map your unique knowledge), Structure (we format it for AI systems), and Deploy (we embed it across ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and other AI platforms). The result? When people ask AI about your space, you're the source they cite."
        },
        {
            question: "How do you measure GEO success?",
            answer: "Simple: we track how often AI systems cite you, in how many contexts, and whether you're the primary or secondary source. We also monitor business impact - qualified leads, brand searches, and authority perception. If AI isn't quoting you more each month, we're not doing our job."
        },
        {
            question: "Do you work with startups or only established companies?",
            answer: "Both - but we're picky. Startups need real, defensible expertise, not just hype. Established companies need to be ready to invest in long-term authority, not quick wins. If you have knowledge worth owning and the commitment to dominate your space in AI, we'll talk."
        },
        {
            question: "What's the investment range for your services?",
            answer: "Starting at $15K/month for foundational work. Comprehensive programs run $25K-$75K/month depending on scope and ambition. We work with a limited number of clients because this isn't scalable agency work - it's strategic authority architecture. You're investing in owning your category in the AI era."
        },
        {
            question: "Can GEO work alongside traditional SEO?",
            answer: "Yes, and they reinforce each other. SEO gets you ranked for human searches. GEO gets you cited by AI. The interesting part? Good GEO often improves your SEO too, because structured, authoritative content works for both humans and machines. It's not either/or - it's both."
        },
        {
            question: "What industries do you specialize in?",
            answer: "Complex, knowledge-intensive spaces where expertise matters: B2B SaaS, enterprise tech, professional services, healthcare innovation, fintech, AI/ML, emerging tech. If your industry requires deep knowledge to understand, and you have that knowledge, we can make AI systems recognize your authority."
        },
        {
            question: "How is this different from content marketing?",
            answer: "Content marketing creates blog posts and whitepapers for humans. GEO structures knowledge for AI systems. We're not writing articles hoping people read them - we're encoding your expertise so AI cites it millions of times. Different audience, different format, exponentially bigger reach."
